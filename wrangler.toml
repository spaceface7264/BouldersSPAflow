# RECOMMENDED: Use Cloudflare Pages (not Workers)
# Deploy command: npx wrangler pages deploy ./dist
# 
# This configuration file is primarily for reference.
# Cloudflare Pages will automatically:
# - Deploy static assets from ./dist
# - Deploy Functions from ./functions directory
# - Handle routing and CORS
#
# For Pages deployment, the [assets] section below is optional
# but can help if using 'wrangler deploy' as a fallback
